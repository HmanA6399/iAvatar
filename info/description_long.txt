I’m a self-taught Web Developer with about 4 years of practice with basic tools; HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, SQL and PHP, also modern leading technologies in the industry like the jQuery library, Angular, Node, NoSQL. Now I’m practicing problem solving to master this powerful tool and use it in Web Dev for optimization of speed and memory for much more efficient web apps. I also do some volunteer work to keep on track and improve my professional skills. I’m seeking an internship or a part-time job during my study years. Good Luck !
